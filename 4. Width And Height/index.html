    <!-- Height and width does not change the size of the image locally, i.e. the time taken to load the image would still be the same, so it's better to change the size of the Image locally rather than in HTML or CSS -->
    <!-- It's better to Crop Images locally using Photoshop or any other software, cropping images with HTML, makes the site Slower -->
